# DJI Onboard SDK ROS  3.3

**Version 3.3 was developed to support N3/A3 FW 1.7.5 and above.**

**M100 users please use version 3.2.**

## Quick Start Guide 

This repository contains the Onboard SDK ROS wrapper and demos. The ROS package requires Onboard SDK (djiosdk-core) to be installed to your system prior to running it. For detailed setup instructions, please follow the documentation [here](http://developer.dji.com/onboard-sdk/documentation/sample-doc/sample-setup.html#ros-oes). 

The ROS package is a full rewrite of DJI Onboard SDK ROS, with changes in APIs, reference frames, communication mechanisms etc. We encourage you to take a look at the documentation for full details. 

ROS Wiki can be found [here](http://wiki.ros.org/dji_sdk). Please be sure to read the [release notes](https://developer.dji.com/onboard-sdk/documentation/appendix/releaseNotes.html).
